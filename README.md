# MLH-Hacklympics-2020
#Inspiration
The inspiration for this project we are huge soccer fans and we noticed that it was difficult to have a chat with like minded friends and also watch the scores and have the stats because we were always having to switch between tabs to monitor all of our different sites and chats. We wanted a single place for everything we wanted while watching the game.

# What it does
Sportchat is a chat app that lets you chat with your friends while seeing live statistics and notifications.

# How we built it
We built it using CSS, Python, Javascript and HTML.

# Challenges we ran into
Time management was a challenge as we had a lot to do and an ambitious plan. We had trouble with the UI as our designer used a program that only uploaded PNG files so we had to translate them to HTML and CSS.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of connecting a sport API to our interface so you can see stats.

# What we learned
We learned how to program buttons, as well as integrating HTML and CSS with Javascript.

# What's next for Sportchat
In the future we would like to complete the UI to include notifications, other sport selection and friends. We would also like to be able to watch live sports on the app.
